                adaptation, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and humanitarian
                action—both in Bangladesh and internationally, particularly in
                Malaysia.

            <p class="card-body">
              At Global MindLens (GML), we go beyond consultancy—we are your
              strategic thought partner in shaping a future where insight
              becomes action and action drives transformation.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              Our work is anchored in a simple belief: evidence has power only
              when it empowers people. We translate research into decisions,
              data into dialogue, and ideas into measurable impact that
              strengthens systems, communities, and organizations worldwide.
            </p>
            <p class="card-body">
              We are guided by four enduring commitments:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li><strong>Evidence with Integrity:</strong> Every conclusion and recommendation is rooted in rigorous data, tested assumptions and ethical inquiry.</li>
              <li><strong>Partnership for Impact:</strong> We co-create solutions that reflect local realities and global standards.</li>
              <li><strong>Inclusion as Principle:</strong> Foregrounding the voices of women, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities.</li>
              <li><strong>Innovation for Change:</strong> Integrating digital tools, participatory models, and systems thinking to stay ahead of the curve.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-body highlight-quote">
              “At Global MindLens, we don’t just study the world—we help redesign
              it through evidence, insight, and leadership.”
